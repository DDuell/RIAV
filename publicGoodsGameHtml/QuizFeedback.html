Let's see whether you understood the rules. The question was: <br>

<i>Say the the other 3 participants and you are all sharing 3 Points. What would be your earnings in Points from this game?
</i>

{{ if player.quizQuestion == Constants.quizQuestion_correct }}
<p class="text-success">You are correct, you would earn {{Constants.quizQuestion_correct}} Points.
</p>

{{ else }}
<p class="text-danger">Your answer {{player.quizQuestion}} was incorrect. You would earn {{Constants.quizQuestion_correct}} Points.
</p>
{{ endif }}

<p>In the quiz example, all together everyone shared 12 Points. 12 Points multiplied by 2 is 24 Points. Your share would then be 6 Points. Adding what is left of your endowment, 5 - 3 = 2 Points, your earnings would be 8 Points.
