In Stage {{ player.participant.numStage }} of the study, you are going to play a game <strong>with 3 other participants in the study</strong>. In the game, you and the other participants receive <strong>{{ Constants.endowment }} Points</strong> as an endowment and choose how much of that endowment to share with the others. 
<br><br>

Whatever you do not share with the others, you can keep for yourself. Whatever the other participants are not sharing, they keep for themselves. But whatever you and the other participants share is then <strong>multiplied by 2</strong> and then <strong>distributed equally</strong> among all other participants, no matter how much you and they shared. Your overall points earned in Stage {{ player.numStage }} will be your share plus whatever is left from your endowment.

Once you click 'Next', we are asking you one questions so that we can see how well you understood the rules. You will <strong>not</strong> earn additional points for answering this <strong>comprehension</strong> question, this is just for you to practice for a moment before you play the actual game.
