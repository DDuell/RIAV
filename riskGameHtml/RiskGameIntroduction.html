<p>
In Stage {{ player.participant.numStage }} of the study, you are going to play <strong>two</strong> games <strong>with 3 other participants in the study</strong>. In each game, each participant chooses between <strong>two options A and B</strong>. 
<br><br>

You can <strong>earn additional points</strong> from playing these games <strong>in two ways</strong>: 
<ol>
<li> <strong>Based on yours and the other 3 participants' choices:</strong> On the screen where we ask you to tell us which choice you would make, we show you for each game how many points you would earn given your choice and the choices of the other 3 participants. 
<br><br>
</li>
<li> <strong>Based on whether you correctly guessed the other 3 participants' choices</strong>
</li>
</ol>

Once you have made your choices in each of the two games, we will choose one of the games randomly and compute the earned points for Stage {{ player.numStage }} for all participants based on their choices. 
<br><br>

When you click 'Next', we will ask you a few questions so you can see how well you understand the rules. You will <strong>not</strong> earn additional points for answering these <strong>comprehension</strong> questions.
