<p>
In Stage {{ player.participant.numStage }} of the study, you are going to play two games  <strong>with 3 other participants in the study</strong>. In each game, each participant chooses between <strong>two options A and B</strong>. 
<br><br>

Depending on your choices and the choices of the 3 other participants, you will earn additional points from playing these games. On the screen where we ask you to tell us which choices you would make, we show you for each game how much points you would earn given your choices and the choices of the other 3 participants. 
<br><br>

Once you have made your choices in each of the two games, we will choose one of them randomly and we compute earned points for Stage {{ player.numStage }} for all participants based on their choices. 
<br><br>

Once you click 'Next', you will see an example of such game so that you can familiarize yourself with how they work. We are also asking you a few questions so that we can see how well you understood the rules. You will <strong>not</strong> earn additional points for answering these <strong>comprehension</strong> questions, this is just for you to practice for a moment before you play the actual games.
